# Responsive Editor Form

An [Angular](https://angular.io) app that has simple editor at its core. The editor that consists of two text form fields. One for the shortened version of a URL shortener, the other for the full URL. 

When in mobile screens, this app opens the editor in an [Angular Material Bottom Sheet](https://material.angular.io/components/bottom-sheet/overview). However, in wider screens, the app opens the editor inside a [Angular Material Drawer](https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/overview).

It also has an [Angular Material Table](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview) to display all created links. Created links don't persist across browser refreshes. 

[LogRocket](https://logrocket.com) is setup too.
